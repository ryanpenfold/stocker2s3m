It appears as though the SOUNDDATA.ROM stores data in a form of semi-chunklike format.

It is highly likely it is one of the following:
      1) Each chunk having Samples, then Instruments, then Sequences
      2) A chunk having samples in one block, then instruments in another, then sequences.
      3) A sample chunk, and sequence chunk.
    
Samples are encoded in PCM16 Signed (majority) and PCM8 (most likely outliers). My ears now hurt, thanks Audacity.
